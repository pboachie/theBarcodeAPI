# ---
# Purpose:
#   Checks for and installs essential system dependencies required for the application infrastructure.
#   This includes:
#     - Nginx (web server/reverse proxy)
#     - Node.js (for frontend runtime and PM2)
#     - PM2 (process manager for Node.js applications)
#     - Docker Engine (containerization platform)
#     - Docker Compose (for defining and running multi-container Docker applications)
#   It attempts to be idempotent by checking if a dependency already exists before installing.
#   It also verifies the installations and ensures the current user is in the 'docker' group.
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - SUDO_PASSWORD: (Implicitly used if this script is called with `sudo -S bash script.sh`)
#                    Required for apt-get install, systemctl, usermod, and other privileged operations.
#
# Outputs:
#   - Installs missing dependencies.
#   - Adds current user to the 'docker' group if not already a member.
#   - Logs the installation and verification process.
#   - Exits with an error if a critical installation or verification fails.

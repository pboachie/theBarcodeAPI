    # If our mcp_server's generate_barcode_mcp tool logs it, that's also separate.
    # The api/mcp.py endpoint itself doesn't await the task, so it won't see the exception directly.
    
    # To truly test the background exception, one might need to patch asyncio.create_task
    # or have a more sophisticated setup to monitor task exceptions.
    # For now, confirming it was called is the primary goal for this unit test.
    # If the exception from `process_request` were to crash the test runner, that would indicate an issue.
    # (pytest-asyncio default strict mode should report unhandled task exceptions)

# Note: The `test_sse_connect_add_client_failure` and `test_mcp_cmd_process_request_failure` tests
# touch on more complex scenarios of error handling in async code and background tasks.
# Their current form is a best effort for unit testing these conditions.
# `test_sse_connect_add_client_failure` expects an unhandled exception to propagate from `add_client`.
# `test_mcp_cmd_process_request_failure` confirms the task is created; background error handling is implicit.

# Final check on test_sse_connect_missing_app_state_sse_transport
# The endpoint now has a try-except AttributeError for sse_transport and mcp_instance.
# If sse_transport is missing, it yields an error event.
# The status code remains 200 OK for EventSourceResponse.
# The test was updated to reflect this.

# Final check on test_mcp_cmd_missing_app_state_mcp_instance & test_mcp_cmd_missing_app_state_sse_transport_for_check
# These now raise HTTPException(503, ...) which results in a 503 status code.
# The tests were updated to reflect this.

# Correcting test_sse_connect_successful data parsing. SSE spec is line-based.
# A typical event:
# event: event_name
# data: some_data_possibly_json
# (empty line)

# Correcting test_sse_connect_missing_app_state_sse_transport to handle specific error event format.
# yield {"event": "error", "data": "Server configuration error: SSE transport not available."}
# This means data will be a JSON string: "Server configuration error: SSE transport not available."
# Not json.loads(data_string).

# In test_sse_connect_successful, data is client_id string, not JSON.
# yield {"event": "client_id", "data": client_id}
# So event_data from stream will be the client_id string directly.

# Re-checking test_sse_connect_successful
# The data part of an SSE event is a string. If it's JSON, the client is expected to parse it.
# In our case, `yield {"event": "client_id", "data": client_id}` from `EventSourceResponse`
# means the `data` field of the SSE message will be the `client_id` string itself.
# The test was: `received_client_id_event = json.loads(event_data)` which is incorrect if client_id is not a JSON string.
# It should be: `assert event_data == TEST_CLIENT_ID`

# Re-checking test_sse_connect_missing_app_state_sse_transport
# `yield {"event": "error", "data": "Server configuration error: SSE transport not available."}`
# Here data is a string.
# `assert event_data_content == "Server configuration error: SSE transport not available."` is correct.

# Adjusting the parsing logic in test_sse_connect_successful and test_sse_client_disconnect_removes_client
# to correctly extract data from the simple "data: <string>" format for the client_id event.
# The current parsing logic seems okay for simple string data.

# One final adjustment for test_sse_connect_successful:
# The line `if line.startswith("event: client_id") and event_data:` might be problematic
# as the `event: client_id` line comes *before* the `data:` line.
# A better way to parse is to accumulate lines until an empty line, then process the event.
# Or, for this simple case, find "event: client_id" then expect "data: <client_id>" on the next relevant line.

# Simpler parsing for the first event in SSE tests:
# Look for "event: client_id"
# Then look for "data: <actual_client_id>"
# This is fragile. A small state machine is better.
# Let's refine the SSE event parsing in the tests for robustness.
# For `test_sse_connect_successful` and `test_sse_client_disconnect_removes_client`:

#Revised parsing logic:
# current_event = {}
# async for line in response.aiter_lines():
#   if not line.strip(): # Empty line, event ended
#       if current_event.get("event") == "client_id" and "data" in current_event:
#           assert current_event["data"] == TEST_CLIENT_ID
#           break
#       current_event = {} # Reset for next event
#   elif line.startswith("event:"):
#       current_event["event"] = line[len("event:"):].strip()
#   elif line.startswith("data:"):
#       current_event["data"] = line[len("data:"):].strip()

# This revised parsing will be implemented in the actual file.
# The provided code block is the initial creation. I will use this refined logic.
